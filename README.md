# React + TypeScript + MUI + Vite

Hi guys and thank you for looking at my project!

I am used to working with tailwind for styling, but trying out MUI has been fun and it has some advantages because it has finished functional components. Maybe I am not aware of some of the best practices related to custom styles, but my focus was to finish the assignment as soon as possible.

When testing this, as you are probably aware, sometimes the POST endpoint `/employees` returns a 500 response for no real reason and I couldn't find a pattern when it happens. The same situation happens on swagger. If that happens to you too, just wait a couple of moments and it should work again.

Overall, I have some ideas on how to improve the code and we can talk more about that in person.
